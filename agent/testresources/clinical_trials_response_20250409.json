Influenza can cause a very serious lung infection (pneumonia) and increase the risk of stroke and heart attacks. Pneumococcal disease can lead to serious infections in the lungs (pneumonia), the blood (bacteremia), and the covering of the brain (meningitis).

Electronic systems can improve follow-up and reduce delays by detecting missed appointments or incomplete procedures so that patients are called back to conduct timely investigations when appropriate. To achieve high standards of patient safety in cancer diagnosis, the investigators not only need to use information technology appropriately but also improve the processes, policies, and procedures of monitoring, communication, and coordination of care.\n\nGiven the importance of cancer-related diagnostic delays in ambulatory care, the investigators need effective methods to detect them, understand their causes, and intervene to reduce them. Manual techniques to detect these delays, such as spontaneous reporting and random chart reviews, have limited effectiveness. Our proposed study focuses on testing methods to proactively identify delays using certain \"triggers\" as they occur and intervene in a timely manner.","detailedDescription":"The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate and test methods by which large health care systems can efficiently identify cancer patients who are more likely to experience diagnostic delays and pre-emptively rectify these delays. This study will build upon tools developed in our recent work (Aim1, prior IRB Protocol Number: H-23801) and test their effectiveness to identify patients at risk of experiencing delays in cancer diagnosis followed by an intervention that the investigators hypothesize will reduce these delays.\n\nThis is Aim 2 (for which the investigators are seeking approval) is the final Aim of this proposal. Aim 1 was approved under Protocol Number: H-23801.\n\nIn Aim 2 the investigators will determine the effectiveness of an IT-based intervention (consisting of data mining using triggers tested in Aim 1 followed by targeted electronic communication and surveillance techniques) to facilitate cancer diagnosis as compared with usual care (no use of trigger or electronic communication and surveillance). Hypothesis 1: The time from first appearance of a diagnostic clue to follow-up action (e.g. colonoscopy performance after a positive FOBT) will be significantly less in the intervention arm than in usual care. Hypothesis 2: The percentage of patients receiving timely follow-up care will be significantly more in the intervention arm than in usual care. To improve the generalizability of our findings to multiple ambulatory care environments, the investigators will conduct our research in two settings: an urban Veterans Affairs facility in Houston, Texas and a large primary care network in central Texas. These settings include internal medicine and family medicine, academic and nonacademic practices, and significant racial, gender, ethnic, age, urban/rural, and socioeconomic diversity. Our study addresses coordination and timeliness of care, both of which are priorities to achieve high quality care.\n\nHypothesis 3: Overall, the trigger will achieve a positive predictive value (PPV) of at least 50% in identifying delays in care. PPV is defined as the number of charts correctly identified with a delay in diagnostic evaluation, divided by the total number of charts identified by the trigger, and was deemed to be the approximately level necessary to avoid substantial contribution to provider alert fatigue."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Colon Cancer","Lung Cancer","Prostate Cancer"],"keywords":["Diagnostic delay","Prevention","Diagnostic errors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1256,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Contact Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention will include activities such as electronic communication and surveillance that facilitate the care of patients experiencing delays.

Major medical organizations recommend that men discuss the risks and benefits of this test with their physician before making the decision. This educational, interactive DA will help them prepare for that discussion.","detailedDescription":"Prostate cancer (CaP) is a formidable public health problem in the US and in industrialized countries worldwide. Methods for primary prevention of CaP are unknown. As a result, early detection has become a mainstay of cancer control efforts. However, there is considerable controversy regarding the efficacy of screening in reducing disease-specific mortality. In light of this uncertainty, major medical organizations, including the National Cancer Institute, currently recommend that men discuss the pros and cons of CaP screening and make individualized screening decisions with their health care providers. However, because of constraints on time during medical encounters, it is not always feasible for providers to engage in in-depth discussions regarding the complexities of this issue. Therefore, interventions to promote informed decision-making (IDM) outside of clinical settings are needed.\n\nIn this study, we propose to: (1) develop an interactive computer-based decision aid (DA) to promote IDM for CaP screening; and (2) conduct a randomized controlled worksite trial to evaluate the impact the DA intervention on employed men's ability to make informed decisions regarding CaP. This work is designed to be responsive to recent calls for IDM interventions in community settings among diverse populations. If successful, our findings could validate the effectiveness of DAs to promote IDM for CaP and serve as a model for widespread dissemination, thus improving quality of care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prostate Cancer"],"keywords":["Computer-Assisted Decision Making","Workplace","Screening"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":812,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Distribution of printed materials"},{"label":"Computer Assisted Decision making tool","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention consisted of access to a computer tailored decision aid designed to promote informed decision making.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Computer Assisted Decision making tool"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Computer Assisted Decision making tool","description":"The intervention consisted of access to a computer tailored decision aid designed to promote informed decision making.","armGroupLabels":["Computer Assisted Decision making tool"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Who Were Ready to Make a Decision or Were Undecided","description":"Readiness to make a decision based on Stage of Decision-Making Scale (O'Connor A et al, 2008) with five responses ranging from \"I haven't thought about it before\" to \"I have made a decision, and I am not likely to change my mind.\" Men were classified as having \"decided\" if they stated either that they had made a decision, but were willing to reconsider, or if they responded that they had made a decision but were unlikely to change their mind.

It is not yet known whether tadalafil is more effective than a placebo in preventing erectile dysfunction.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying tadalafil to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing erectile dysfunction in patients with prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy.","detailedDescription":"OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\n* To determine whether tadalafil maintains spontaneous (off-drug) erectile function, as measured by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) as compared to placebo at weeks 28-30 after initiation of radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer.\n\nSecondary\n\n* Determine the difference in spontaneous (off-drug) erectile function between tadalafil and placebo at 1 and 2 years.\n* Determine the difference in overall sexual function as measured by the IIEF between tadalafil and placebo at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.\n* Determine differences in patient and partner overall sexual satisfaction as measured by the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire (SAQ) between tadalafil and placebo at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.\n* Determine differences in patient and partner marital adjustment as measured by Locke's Marital Adjustment Test (LMAT) between tadalafil and placebo at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.\n* Determine associations between patient and partner overall sexual satisfaction as measured by SAQ and patient and partner marital adjustment as measured by LMAT at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.\n* Determine patient-related factors (i.e., age, pretreatment sexual response, tobacco use, and comorbidities) that may predict response to tadalafil therapy at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.\n* Determine the difference in adverse events between tadalafil and placebo as assessed by Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0 criteria.\n\nTertiary\n\n* Characterization of preference and erectile function among patients who choose to stay on (or if on placebo, to start) tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor other than tadalafil, a non-PDE5-inhibitor erectile aide, or no PDE5 inhibitor or erectile aide at 28-30 weeks and at 1 and 2 years.\n* Identification of radiotherapy factors (i.e., modality, prescribed total dose, planning target volume margin, penile bulb dose-volume parameters) associated with erectile function.\n* Evaluation of the number of patients screened for eligibility, the number eligible that are presented the study, the number who refuse, and the number who are accrued.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (≤ 65 years vs \\> 65 years) and radiotherapy treatment (external beam radiation therapy vs brachytherapy\\*). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nNote: \\* Radiotherapy start date for brachytherapy patients is the date of the procedure.\n\nAll patients undergo either external beam radiotherapy alone to the prostate ± seminal vesicles only or low-dose rate permanent brachytherapy alone.\n\n* Arm I: Beginning ≤ 7 days after the start of radiotherapy, patients receive oral tadalafil once daily for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n* Arm II: Beginning ≤ 7 days after the start of radiotherapy, patients receive oral placebo once daily for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients complete the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire (SAQ), the Locke's Marital Adjustment Test (LMAT) (if applicable), and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Sexual Medications and Devices Evaluations Supplement questionnaires periodically. Partners or spouses complete the SAQ-Partner, LMAT (if applicable), and IIEF questionnaires periodically.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28-30 weeks, and annually for up to 2 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prostate Cancer","Sexual Dysfunction"],"keywords":["sexual dysfunction","stage IIB prostate cancer","stage IIA prostate cancer","adenocarcinoma of the prostate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":242,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tadalafil","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tadalafil","interventionNames":["Drug: Tadalafil"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tadalafil","description":"Beginning ≤ 7 days after the start of radiotherapy, patients receive oral tadalafil 5mg once daily for 24 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Tadalafil"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Beginning ≤ 7 days after the start of radiotherapy, patients receive oral placebo once daily for 24 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Maintaining Spontaneous (Off-drug) Erectile Function (EF) at Weeks 28-30 After Initiation of Radiation Therapy (RT)","description":"EF is measured by Question 1 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).

It is not yet known whether zoledronate is more effective than calcium and vitamin D alone in preventing osteoporosis and bone fractures in patients with prostate cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying zoledronate to see how well it works compared to calcium and vitamin D alone in preventing osteoporosis and bone fractures in patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy and hormone therapy.","detailedDescription":"OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\n* Compare the potential benefit of bisphosphonate therapy comprising zoledronate plus vitamin D and calcium supplement vs standard therapy with vitamin D and calcium supplement in the prevention of osteoporosis and associated bone fractures in patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate undergoing radiotherapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy.\n\nSecondary\n\n* Evaluate the potential benefit of these regimens on quality of life in these patients.\n* Evaluate the potential benefit in bone mineral density over a period of 3 years for patients treated with these regimens.\n\nOUTLINE: This is randomized multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to T score of the hip by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (\\< -1.0 but \\> -2.5 vs ≥ - 1.0) and planned duration of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy (1-2½ years vs \\> 2½ years).
