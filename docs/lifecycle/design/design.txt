KaggleGenAICapstone2025Q1

A Kaggle notebook has been created for this project and will be 
made public when finished
https://www.kaggle.com/code/nicholeasuniquename/genaicapstone2025q1

The wiki i/o pages attached to the github project will be used to
host a description of the project and creating it.

If have time, will make a YouTube video and post a link to it on
the wiki.

---------------------------------------------------------------
The design will be presented as stories and tasks in agile manner.
The task details will be in the implementation directory.

Time estimates are omitted for this short sprint of everything
neededing to be finished within a week considering external factors.

Stories:

(1) logging
    log the evaluations, feedback, and basic stats of user session
(2) session id
    provide a uniq session id w/ high probability
(3) prompt
    provide a prompt to the LLM to summarize the text for readability
(4) clinical trial request function
    makes API request for published completed trial for disease treatement,
    rehibilition, prevention, therapy
(5) clinical trial parser and filter function
    parses the trial results and filters out any missing citations
(6) publication request function
    makes API request for the abstract of the citation
(7) public parser function
    parse response and return abstract
(8) code for LLM summization given prompt and article and presentation
    the notebook code to use the LLM for text summarization
    and to present the results
(9) code to use another LLM to evaluate the first response and rate it.
(10) function for user feedback
     if user want to provide feedback, options are radio buttons:
       good results and summary, good results + bad summary,
       bad results, harmful summary, other
     if harmful is selected, user has ability to send email to support
     and to request a response if they provide their email
(11) code for evaluating the logs and feedback
(12) internal function to create seed data for the notebook logs
     and feedback directories, usable for evaluation
(13) paste the tested code into the Kaggle notebook 
     documenting the pieces and goals
(14) generate the seed data for logs and feedback for evals
(15) run and save the notebook
(16) remove the seed data generation method as it detracts from the
     notebook explanations
